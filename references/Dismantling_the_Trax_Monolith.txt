Trax – Dismantling the Trax Monolith: A Strategic Roadmap

1 Background
Payment Hub, a financial application facilitating corporate to corporate fund transfers, has been a
cornerstone of FIS(T&R) for over two decades. With more than 150 clients already onboarded and a steady
annual growth, it stands as our flagship product. However, over time, the application has evolved into a
monolithic platform, posing significant challenges in areas such as client onboarding, clients upgrades,
operational excellence and innovation.

2 The Challenge: The Legacy Burden
The current monolith architecture, over time, has become a bottleneck to innovation, and scalability,
hindering our ability to meet evolving business needs and maintain a competitive edge. The following points
details the specifics issues stemming from this legacy system:
• Monolithic Architecture Limitation: The current platform architecture has become a 'big ball of mud'
overtime, making it difficult to understand, change and maintain.
• Code Complexity & Technical Debt: Thousands of lines of code have created a significant technical
debt, slowing development, and increasing risk of bugs.
• Lack of Documentation: The aging codebase suffers from lack of comprehensive up-to-date
documentation, making it even more difficult for developers to understand, maintain and debug the
system.
• Limited Team Knowledge: "Bus Factor" is high, meaning the platform knowledge resides with a small
group, creating single point of failure for understanding and maintenance.
• Slow Development Cycle: Changes requires review by a small group of reviewers, extensive testing
and coordination, leading to long release cycle and delayed time to market.
• Scaling Challenges: Scaling the entire monolith is inefficient and costly, individual components
cannot be scaled independently.
• High Maintenance Costs: Significant resources are dedicated to maintaining the aging codebase,
leaving less for innovation.
• Deployment Bottleneck: Frequent deployments are risky, time consuming, and complex, hindering
continuous delivery.
• Risk of Single Point of Failure: A failure in one part of the monolith can bring down the entire system.
• Difficulty in Adopting New Technologies: Integrating new technologies into a monolithic architecture
is challenging and often risky.
• Outdated UI: Current GUI experience and technology is completely outdated and difficult to maintain.
• Lagging Behind Competitors: Our competitors, leveraging more modern architecture, are able to
introduce new features and adapt to market changes faster, putting us at a disadvantage.
• Complex Customer Onboarding and Upgrades: Configuring new customers platforms and upgrading
existing customer platforms is complicated, time consuming, and expensive due to tightly coupled
nature of the monolith.
• Difficulty Meeting Non-Functional Requirements: The monolith struggles to meet modern nonfunctional requirements around security, scalability, resilience, observability, performance, and user
experience requirement like accessibility.
• Data Achieving Challenges: Due to the monolithic database structure, achieving older data is
complex, and negatively impact performance. This makes it difficult to manage data growth and
comply to data retention and governance policies.

3 The Vision: A Microservices and Event Driven Future
The vision is to decompose the ‘monolith’ into highly scalable, event-driven microservices, which are cloud
native and cloud vendor agnostic. This architecture will have the following features:
• Microservices Architecture: Independent, deployable services focused on specific business
capabilities.
• Event Driven Design: Asynchronous communication between services via events promoting loose
coupling and improved performance.
• Decoupled Micro Front End: Independent, deployable UI owned by individual micro services teams.
Each team can work on and release their UI changes independently, without being blocked by other
teams or monolith.
• Improved Scalability: Independent scaling of services based on demand, optimizing resources
utilization and cost.
• Enhanced Resilience: Fault isolation, failures in one service do not necessarily impact others.
• Faster Development Cycles: Smaller, focused teams can work independently, accelerating
development, deployment and releases.
• Easier adoption of New Technologies: Flexibility to choose the best tool for each service, fostering
innovation.
• Reduced Maintenance Cost: Simplified codebase, reduced blast radius, comprehensive
documentation will reduce development and maintenance cost.
• Foster Innovation: The microservices architecture will enable faster innovation cycles, allowing us to
quickly develop and deploy new features and services.
• Competitive Advantage: A modern, flexible architecture will allow us to better compete with
competitors by enabling faster adaptation to market changes and the rapid introduction of new
features.
• Enhanced Security: Microservices can be secured individually, simplifying the application security
patches and improving overall platform security.
• Improved Observability: Individual services are easier to monitor and troubleshoot, providing better
insights into platform health and performance.
• Simplified Archiving: Decoupled data stores associated with individual microservices will simplify
data archiving and enable more granular control over data retention and governance policies.
• Simplified and Cost Effective Customer Onboarding and Upgrades: The decoupled nature of the
microservices simplifies and makes more cost-effective configuration of new customers platforms
and the upgrading of existing ones.

4 State of the Nation: The Current Platform Landscape
We have already embarked on our monolith decomposition journey, making a decent progress. The Direct
Debit Engine, Bank Connector and Batch Approval components have been successfully extracted and are
now operating as independent microservices. Bank Reporting is currently in progress, undergoing migration
to a microservices architecture as well. However, the remaining monolith still houses several key
functionalities, Scheduler, Workers, GUI, Reporting, Config, Payment Factory, Cash Flow generation,
Reconciliation and Elastic Search.
While we have migrated some services to a microservices architecture, inconsistencies in their
implementation have emerged. A key part of our ongoing modernization effort will also be aligning these
services to ensure a cohesive and standardized approach across our microservices ecosystem.

Relevant points about the microservices in the current state:
• Bank Connector is only used in communications with Bank. It has potential to handle all
communications such as with ERP systems and Treasury management systems.
• Direct Debit workflow is partially implemented in new microservices and partially in Trax
• One GUI is only available for PHSE customers
• Approval service is currently only implemented for PAY workflow. It also does not have support for all
the Signing methods.

5 The Transformation Journey: An Iterative Approach
This transformation is a multi-year journey and requires a careful planning and execution. Throughout this
process, we must ensure uninterrupted service, continuing to onboard new customers, upgrade existing
customers platforms, add new features, and adhere to evolving regulations and compliance requirement, all
while modernizing the platform.
These principles will guide our multi-year monolith transformation, ensuing we balance modernization with
ongoing business needs and minimize disruption.
• Iterative Approach: The transformation will be executed iteratively, adding value in each iteration,
also allowing us to learn and adapt along the way, minimizing risk and maximizing flexibility.
• Business Value Driven: Prioritization of service extraction will be driven by business value, focusing
on areas that deliver greatest impact and return of investment.
• Continuous Delivery and Minimal Disruption: We will prioritize continuous delivery of new features
and maintain uninterrupted service to existing customers throughout the transformation. Disruption
to ongoing operation will be minimised at every stage.
• Building New Business Features as Microservices: All new business features will be developed as
independent microservices from the outset, ensuring no wasted effort on building within the monolith
and accelerating to a fully microservices based platform.
• Compliance and Regulatory Adherence: Adherence to all relevant regulations and compliance
requirements will be maintained throughout the modernization process.
• Shift Left and Robust Testing: We will implement a shift left testing approach, integrating testing
throughout the development lifecycle, from unit tests, component tests, contract test, security tests
and end to end tests. The end to end testing framework will be upgraded to support microservices
based new platform end to end testing.
• Continuous Monolith Optimisation: The remaining monolith will be continuously refactored and
optimised as functionalities are migrated, improving its maintainability and performance.
• Platform Configuration Blueprint: A comprehensive platform configuration blueprint will be
developed and maintained throughout this journey, ensuring consistency and repeatability in
customer onboarding and upgrading their platforms.
• Comprehensive Documentation: We will create and maintain comprehensive documentation
including service documentation, product manuals, and runbooks, to facilitate knowledge sharing,
improve maintainability and streamline operations.
In our recent workshop in Brussels, we reviewed the platform's current state, and brainstormed to produce a
transformation strategy. The outcome of this workshop is a multi phase / iteration roadmap based on the
above principles which will guide the platform evolution:

The Transformation Journey: An Iterative Approach – 7

Trax – Dismantling the Trax Monolith: A Strategic Roadmap

5.1 Phase 1

In this iteration, we will try to achieve the following:
• Config Orchestrator
a. Currently Trax is used as a Config Server and every microservice is calling Config Server. Trax
works with a limited set of, and hence we have issues, when workers demand is high.
b. In this iteration, we will build a Config Orchestrator as a new microservice, it will pull data from
the Trax Monolith during it start up, and then store it locally. This data will be versioned and
tenant specific.
c. All new microservices will use the Config Orchestrator, while Trax components will continue
using the existing mechanism to pull configuration data.
• Bank Connector - Communication Service
a. Bank Connector will be rebranded as Communication Service
b. Run mode will be added to it.
c. It will continue using Artemis, and the data transfer will be value based and encrypted.
• Bank Reporting
a. We will align the tech implementation across all microservices and prefer a cloud agnostic
approach
b. Kafka will replace SQS as Event Bus.
c. We will integrate with the Config Orchestrator service and remove Elasticache Redis for cost
optimization.
• File Mapper
a. Currently Direct Debit uses Trax for communications. The incoming file is parsed in Trax using
File mapper and events are generated on Kafka.
b. We would like to move this File Mapper as a standalone microservice, so that it can be used
initially for Direct Debit and, in the future, for other formats.
c. The File Mapper supports Groovy DSL, and we can use as library for all ERP/TMS/Bank
formats.

• Logi Replacement(Refer here fore more detailed strategy: Logi replacement Strategy1)
a. We will start with basic POC and solution design.
b. Client Communication - Informing the Logi replacement situation, asking for upgrade to public
cloud

5.2 Phase 2

In this iteration, we will try to achieve the following:
• Automated Test Framework (ATF)
a. Currently, ATF resides within Trax and is mainly used for black box testing of Trax. Some
customers also use ATF.
b. ATF will be extracted from Trax Monolith as ATF 2.0 and should be usable for black box
testing across multiple microservice at the Payment Hub level.
• Communication Service
a. Replace Artemis by Kafka
b. Input files will be stored in Cloud Storage (AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage) and a reference to
the data with other meta data will be puhsed to Kafka as an event
c. Communication Service UI will be merged with One GUI and security will be behind Overtow /
Security proxy.
• File Mapper
a. The File mapper will start supporting payment formats (steps towards Payment microservice)
b. The File Mapper will parse the payment file and convert text to JSON event.
c. These JSON events will be consumed by Trax and persisted to Payment Model. (Payment
processing is still done in Trax in this phase)
d. This will help us build a Conceptual JSON model for a future Payment microservice.
• Approval
a. Currently, Payment Approval Service only supports Password and TOTP approvals.

b. For all French customers, we need hardware approvals and currently only supported in Trax
and Trax signing Application
c. Trax Signing Application has lots of other limitations - works with electrons, need to ship
separate installer, need to install on each client laptop, difficult to maintain etc.
d. We will update Approval service to support browser plugins for hardware reading.
e. This will eliminate the Trax signing Application and its limitations
• Bank Reporting
a. Account Statement, Intraday Statements, Debit-Credit is linked with the Payments (Has
information or Transactional info)
b. After this iteration, we will have linking between Payment and Bank Reporting (reconciliation)
c. For our We will be moving towards first customer (currently PPRO is interested) & will have/
map with customer requirements
• Scheduler Service
a. Trax has a scheduler service and is used for all scheduling activities
b. Each microservices also require a scheduler (Currently dependent on Trax).
c. New Service will still refer to configuration in Trax but generate events on Kafka & Artemis so
that each microservice and Trax will consume those events
• Logi Replacement
a. Current schedule reports of Logi will get converted into Birt
b. Will have information on which Logi Analytics and Operational reports are used by which
client (Plan to decommission all unused reports)

5.3 Phase 3

In this iteration, we will try to achieve the following:
• Bank reporting
a. Account Statement, Intraday Statements, Debit-Credit will generate Cash Flow, Postings
b. We will be ready for go live with PPRO
• Direct Debit

a. For features like Signing, Warehouse we send data to Trax using DD-read model
b. Will start moving to new storage (no more read model service)
c. For Signing we will depend on Approval microservice, Warehouse will depend on New GUI
(Actions)
• One GUI
a. It will now be available for all enterprise customers.
• Logi replacement
a. Replace Analytics and dashboards with new solution

Phase 4

In this iteration, we will try to achieve the following:
• Bank reporting
a. Current File Parsing for CAMT & MT940 formats are part of Bank reporting service.
b. We would start aligning them to FileMapper.
• Direct Debit
a. After this iteration there will be no link to Trax.
b. This will be foundation or say 80% ready for Payment Service
• Logi replacement
a. Rolling out the replacement to Customers

5.4 Phase 5

Final State of the application
• Communication Service: All communication into and out of Payment Hub will happen through
Communication Service
• One GUI: All user interactions with the application will go through Security Proxy and handled at One
GUI. This will also take care of multi-tenant user access. New screens will be built for the new
backend services.
• Event Driven: All microservice communication will be based on events published on Kafka, except in
few cases where data is being queried, in which case REST APIs will be used.
• Engines: Multiple engines will process the individual items in a stateless manner
• Multi-tenancy: All services will be multi-tenant capable.
• Config API: The monolith Trax will be reduced to just the Config API, once all the other logical
modules are moved out into microservices.

5.5 Deployment View
